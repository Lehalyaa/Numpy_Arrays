# Experiment 8 - Basic Tools of EDA Using Numpy Arrays

NumPy (Numerical Python) is the foundational library for scientific computing in Python. Numpy has a function called as ndarray (n-dimensional array), a data structure designed for speed, memory efficiency, and mathematical elegance.

### Aim:

To study about the basic tools used for EDA using NumPy arrays

### Tools used:

Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook

### Theory:

NumPy (Numerical Python) is the foundational library for scientific computing in Python. While Python lists are versatile, they aren't designed for heavy-duty mathematical processing. NumPy fills this gap by introducing the ndarray (n-dimensional array), a data structure designed for speed, memory efficiency, and mathematical elegance.

**Functions of Numpy Arrays:**

**(i)The concept of homogeneity:**

--> In Python, a list can contain elements of various data types inside it. It is because the list stores only the memory address of the data.

--> Numpy arrays can store elements of a particular data type only inside it.

--> This allows the system to know how many bits each and every element occupies so that the system can jump wherever and whenever needed.

--> It makes it fast and efficient instead of going all over again to search for an element.

**(ii) Contiguous Blocks of Data:**

--> Numpy arrays store data as contiguous blocks of memory, i.e., the data is stored next to each other in RAM.

--> Since the NumPy elements are adjacent, it makes it easier for the processor while fetching the data, i.e., the processor can predetermine the upcoming element and fetch them.

**(iii) The Metadata:**

--> The numpy elements have 2 types of data.

* Raw Data

* Metadata

--> The raw data simply means the memory buffer.

--> Whereas a meat data is how the raw data is interpreted.

It includes the dimension of an array, the data type of the elements present inside it, etc.

**(iv) Views vs. Copies:**

--> Since NumPy is designed for massive datasets, it avoids copying the data whenever possible.

--> When slicing or reshaping of an array takes place, NumPy usually creates a view.

--> This is just new metadata, which is shown to the user.

--> But if any changes are made in this view mode, the original array also changes.

**Basic Commands Used in NumPy:**

* np.array—Used to create a new array or convert a Python list to an array

  

* np.linspace—It is used as an alternative for step size in arrays.

  

* .ndim—Returns the number of axes the array has

  

* .shape—Returns a tuple representing the dimensions (rows, columns)

  

* np.sum - Gives the sum of all elements in the array

  

* np.mean—calculates the arithmetic mean of all elements

### Applications of Numpy Arrays:

* Digital Image Processing: For a computer an image is seen as a 3D NumPy array.

* Data Science and Tabular Analytics: Financial institutes run Monte Carlo simulations to predict stock market behavior.

* Machine Learning and AI: The systems used in this are built on tensors, which are nothing but N-dimensional arrays.

   

### Advantages:

* Speed: Loops are not used to perform any major functions; instead, vectorization is done.

* Memory Efficiency:

--> Every data has the same data type, so no type data needs to be stored.

--> Since it stores the data where the raw data is stored, no extra memory of address needs to be stored.

### Learning Outcomes:

* The NumPy array is the same as Python lists, but it can handle massive data very quickly and efficiently.

* It doesn't create a duplicate copy of the array every time some change is done; instead, a view is created where the array can be modified.

* Similar to lists, aggregate functions can be used in arrays also.

* The only difference between NumPy arrays and Python lists is the homogeneity of elements stored inside them.

* Predictability and Consistency: NumPy arrays are statically typed; they prevent a lot of common bugs found in data science.

### Conclusion:

Thus, basic commands in NumPy are executed in a basic array, and the output is verified.
